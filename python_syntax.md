Certainly! Here's the equivalent code in Python for the given operations on different data types:


1. Dynamic Arrays (List):
```python
a = []
a.append(element)
a.remove(element)
del a[index]
size = len(a)
last = a[i]
```

2. String:
```python
str_var = "Hello, World!"
temp = str_var
size = len(str_var)
char_at_i = str_var[i]
```

3. Char:
```python
ch = 'A'
```

5. Stack:
Python doesn't have a built-in implementation of a traditional stack. Lists in Python can be used as stacks

6. Queue:

```python
Python's `deque` can be used as a double-ended queue, Python has queue but its more for complicated task not used for DSA
from collections import deque

q = deque()
q.append(element)
q.popleft()
size = len(q)
front = q[0]
```

7. Deque:
```python
from collections import deque

deque_var = deque()
deque_var.appendleft(element)
deque_var.append(element)
deque_var.popleft()
deque_var.pop()
first = deque_var[0]
last = deque_var[-1]
size = len(deque_var)
```

8. Priority Queue (using heapq):
```python
import heapq

pq = []
heapq.heappush(pq, element)
heapq.heappop(pq)
size = len(pq)
peek = pq[0]
```

9. Map (Dictionary):
```python
map_dict = {}
map_dict[key] = value
map_dict.pop(key, None)
size = len(map_dict)
if key in map_dict:
    value = map_dict[key]
```

10. Set:
```python
s = set()
s.add("Element1")
s.remove("Element2")
size = len(s)
iterator = iter(s)
if next(iterator, None) is not None:
    first_element = next(iterator)
if target_element in s:
    # Do something
```

Note: Python dictionaries can be used as maps.
